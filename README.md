# Custom Aurora DX

This is my own custom Universal Blue image, that is based off of the aurora-dx:daily-stable which I use for work. I have customised the <https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template> template to build this image.

# Rebasing to this image

Feel free to use this image if you wish, but I will not be providing support for this image

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker:ghcr.io/wolfyreload/aurora-ewx:stable
```
